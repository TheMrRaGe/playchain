# Script to process the raw data for the BITS airdrop to holders of
# Huntercoin balances at the time of the snapshot.  It reads the raw
# data in snapshot-balances.json, converts the addresses (HUC->BITS
# based on the same pubkey hash / private key) and computes the
# BITS balance to be assigned to each of the addresses.  The output is
# printed as JSON to stdout.
#
# The base58 processing is done using pybitcointools, which must be on the
# PYTHONPATH and can be obtained here:
#
#   https://github.com/vbuterin/pybitcointools
#
# This script needs to be run from within the contrib/playchain/huc-snapshot
# directory.
