# This Python script can be used to easily claim all BITS from the
# Huntercoin snapshot, based on your Huntercoin wallet.  The BITS addresses
# with coins from the snapshot will be imported into the wallet with label
# 'huc-snapshot' (can be changed by editing the file below).  No rescan
# is run, so make sure to manually rescan the Playchain wallet to make all
# balances show up.
#
# The script reads the input data from 'processed-snapshot.json', so
# should be run from the source directory in the repository!
#
# The JSON-RPC interface URLs for the Huntercoin and Playchain Core daemons must
# be given on the command-line as arguments, and both wallets must be unlocked.
# They should include all credentials and wallet names already where
# applicable, e.g.
#
#   http://huc:password@localhost:8399
#   http://playchain:password@localhost:8396/wallet/walletname
